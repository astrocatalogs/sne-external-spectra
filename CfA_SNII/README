############################
# GENERAL INFORMATION
############################

The spectra (*.flm) are organized in subdirectories, one per
supernova. The file naming convention for each spectrum is:

   <SN name>-<UT date>-<tel/inst>.flm

   SN name : supernova name (e.g., sn2008bf)
   UT date : UT date at midpoint of observations, YYYYMMDD.ddd format
   tel/inst: name of telescope or instrument; choices are:

   	     fast : FLWO 1.5m+FAST
	     mmt  : MMT 6.5m+Blue/Red Channel

The spectra are all in three-column ascii format:

1st column = *observed* wavelength (units = Angstroems [A])
2nd column = *observed* flux (units = erg/s/cm^2/A)
3rd column = flux error (one sigma; units = erg/s/cm^2/A)

NOTES: 

(1) the flux error is computed based on the optimal extraction
    algorithm of Horne (1986).

(2) no attempt has been made to scale the spectra to match the
    available photometry.

(3) the observed wavelength includes a heliocentric correction.


====> THE SPECTRA HAVE *NOT* BEEN DE-REDSHIFTED OR DE-REDDENED <====


Other files are also included:

cfaspec_snII.pdf - single document containing plots of all the spectra
cfasnII_mjdspec.dat - table giving MJD of each spectrum

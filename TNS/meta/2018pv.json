			"remarks":"The spectrum resembles with that of a normal Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) at the pre-maximum stage. Using the automatic SN classification tool, GELATO (Harutyunyan et al., 2008, A&A, 488, 383), the spectrum would be similar to that of SN 1992A at the 5 days before maximum. We identified the absorption lines of the CaII IR triplet, OI 7774, SiII 6355, SiII 5972, SII W-shape feature, and Fe II multiplet in our spectrum. The CaII IR triplet, OI 7774, and SiII 6355 line velocities were measured to be ~16500, ~16500, and ~13000 km/s, respectively.  The SiII 5972 absorption line was significantly deeper than that of SN 1992A, suggesting that this SN might be a more subluminous event.  We measured the equivalent width (EW) of the NaID line as to 0.9 angstrom, suggesting that the host galactic extinction could be very large (A_V~0.5-2.0). Even if the extinction is corrected for, this SN could be still in the rising phase. Follow-up observations could be encouraged. ",

The data contained in this distribution complement a publication from
the Nearby Supernova Factory (SNfactory).  The acquisition, reduction,
and analysis of these data are fully described in that work.  SNfactory
is providing these data to be used by other scientists for the purpose
of furthering their analyses.  Work benefitting from the use of these
data should include the following citation, conveniently included here
as an aastex bibliography entry that may be cut and pasted into a
manuscript:

\bibitem[Thomas et al.(2007)]{Thomas07} Thomas, R.~C., et al.\ 2007, 
\apjl, 654, 53

Some or all of the data included here will eventually be superceded by
improved reductions in a subsequent SNfactory data release.  Users are
strongly advised to confirm with the SNfactory that they are working
with the most up-to-date version of the data available.  For the same
reason, we discourage open redistribution of these data and ask that
others come to the SNfactory directly to obtain these data rather than
obtaining a copy from a third party.  A link to the SNfactory website
would be acceptable, but not alteration or re-hosting of the data.

In short, we wish for data obtained directly from the SNfactory to be an
authoritative representation of its work.
